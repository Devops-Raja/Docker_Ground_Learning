Docker & Docker Compose: Build and Manage a Java Spring Boot + MongoDB application

#TASK & Requirement

-->This is a web application built on the Spring Boot framework and uses MongoDB as a database. 
In this sprint, the team wishes to use Docker to build an image that includes the web application and 
to use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployment of the web application alongside its required components, 
such as the MongoDB database, ensuring seamless integration and efficient management of the entire application stack

-->eed to deploy the application with Docker Compose and ensure it successfully connects to the database. 
Once this is working, expose the application to the outside for testing purposes. 
Do a manual acceptance test and ensure the application is working as expected and that any data is persistently stored. 
Please use known Docker best practices. 
Make sure to create the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml manifest files needed to build and deploy the application,
as they will be added to the Version Control System (Git) by the team.
